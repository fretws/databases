Databases have been a difficult technology to perfect.
Fraught with issues of maintainability, rigidity, and even physical deteriorization, it has taken thousands of years for organization and subsequent innovation to arrive at the current state of the art.
Here we discuss some of the background of this development, including the major pitfalls and remedies.

### History of Data Management
For thousands of years, the best data storage systems were based in paper (or at times more accurately, papyrus). These systems were cheap and easy to use, requiring no expertise beyond reading and writing.
These systems were subject to deteriorization and costly to back up, so we eventually developed computerized databases to store these records.
What we didn't realize at the time was that, while the organization of paper-based systems makes sense due to the limitations of paper inself, there is a better way to organize data in a computerized system: with relations.
A relational database is overall better adapted to updates in information. We'll use the example of a stock market database. A change to an stock's name in a well-designed relational database entails changing the information in one section of the database.
This is opposed to having to search across the database's records of stock transactions for everywhere that stock was bought, and changing each occurence of its name, hoping you don't miss one.
Additionally, relational databases excel over their hierarchical counterparts in the amount of storage they require.
This, coupled with compartmentalization of information, leads to queries that do not have to process nearly as many entries, and are therefore much faster.


### Organize or die
Organization allows us to gain information that sets us ahead of the competition. Without large amounts of data, one would never be able to gain the business insights that Walmart, Amazon, and Starbucks thrive off of.
Organization allows for specialists who are able to innovate.
Specialists are generally able to apply their knowledge anywhere their field is in action (specialists are interchangeable resources).
A great example of the power of specialization comes from my capstone group this quarter. Being terrible at conducting literature reviews, it has taken me four times as long as my group mates to find the required number of scholarly sources. If I were able to spend my time working on my specialties instead of literature review, I would be contributing far more to the project's development.


### Systems Development Lifecycle
The systems development lifecycle helps to avoid the creation of software solutions that are overly costly, unmaintainable and/or do not meet the needs of its users. The cycle designates plenty of time to defining and understanding the system's purpose, standards, requirements, and user base, all before beginning the design phase. Having all of these pieces in place before a design (or worse, implementation) is rendered saves resources that otherwise would be wasted on an incorrect solution. Of course, there will always be bumps on the road to a complete solution that lead to minor redefinitions of the pre-design phases, but a proper execution of the development lifecycle should avoid any truly insurmountable barriers.
